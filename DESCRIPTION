Description: Augment evolution variables to a longitudinal study dataset. 
    Epidemiological studies serve as basis for the identification of risk 
    factors associated with a medical outcome. Longitudinal epidemiological 
    data comprise information from assessments that are repeatedly conducted 
    over time. 
    This package aims at exploiting temporal information inherent to these 
    data by extracting so called "evolution features". Theses features reflect 
    a study participant's individual change over time, his/her change over time 
    in comparison with the cluster he/she was closest to at the baseline 
    examinations, and the change of whole participant groups.
